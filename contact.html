                <p>My name is Denis Li and I’m have been involved with Science Olympiad at Mounds View since 2012. I have attend 3 nationals, (captaining a team with Jon for one of them) My favorite events are It’s About Time, Technical Problem Solving and Compound Machines. Science Olympiad was by far my favorite thing that I did in High School and I hope our tournament will be a blast for everyone attending!</p>

                <p>Hi, my name is Rohan Chakraborty, and I’m an alum of Seven Lakes High School and Beckendorff Junior High in Katy, Texas. Throughout my Science Olympiad experience, I’ve competed extensively in building events such as Gravity Vehicle and Scrambler as well in as lab events like Chemistry Lab and Forensics. With my experience at the national level, I’m looking forward to creating an unforgettable experience for Science Olympians in the beautiful Bay Area! Fun Fact: I love anything and everything Drake.</p>

                <p>Hi! I’m Alex! I competed in Science Olympiad for three years at Palo Alto High School, and while I don’t have a decreasing series of numbers as elegant as Ryan’s, I’ve experienced a variety of study/lab events at Regionals, States, and Nationals. Honestly I thought the 2015 season as one of Paly’s captains would be my last year involved with SciOly, like ever, but I guess I’m not getting away from this one! For anyone at Nationals in 2013, we were that dorky team that had dyed our hair (all of it) green. Additional fun fact: this picture is from States 2015 because my high school plans prom on the same day.</p>

                <p>Hey, I’m Ryan! I’ve competed in Science Olympiad for 7 years, done build events for 6, gone to state for 5, coached a team for 4, proctored B division for 3, captained a team for 2, and supervised an A division event for 1 year. I’m from Mira Loma High School in Sacramento, where I’ve had the unparalleled pleasure of competing repeatedly and unwillingly in Mission Possible, as well as less-hellish events including Circuit Lab, MagLev, Compound Machines, and TPS. I also hold the incredible honor of once placing absolute dead last at Nationals. 60th place in Junkyard challenge, 2011. Shoutout to my coaches for never letting me forget it!</p>
